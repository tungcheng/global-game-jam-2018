# Flap Over Darkness

This is a repo of game I've written at VietNam Global-Game-Jam-2018. The idea start from Flappy Bird and I added some new features.

## new features (compare to original Flappy Bird)
- Continue game in same map-level.
- Darkness cover new obstacle that come from the right of game-screen.
- The dead-birds keep stay on ground to make player feel more angry.
- Leaning obstacle
